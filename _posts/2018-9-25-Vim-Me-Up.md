[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is one of the oldest text editors that is still very popular today. Until recently I had been using vim to edit files remotely on linux servers only and to be honest, I found it very deficult and confusing to use. That was until I opened vimtutor and my life changed for the best.

####Why Use Vim?

Like I said before vim is a very old text editor, why would anyone in their right mind be still using it today given the number of morden text editors that are out their today. According to the [vim](https://www.vim.org/) website, vim is rock stable, is continuously being developed to become even better and has the following killer features:

* persistent, multi-level undo tree
* extensive plugin system
* support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
* powerful search and replace
* integrates with many tools

For me the main advantage, as someone who spends a lot of time working on linux systems, is that vim is shipped with most linux distributions and I get the benefit of working with the same editor when I switch environments.

####How do I install vim?

If you are using a linux operating system, chances are you already have vim installed and can access it using the following commands:
>vim
OR
>vi

If it is not installed or you are using windows or mac detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.vim.org/download.php).

####How do I launch Vim?

Vim can either be launched from the command line using the commands given in the previous section or from the start menu depending on the system on which it is installed.

####How do I type text in Vim?

Vim is a unique text editor in that it uses the concept of modes and the meaning of each keyboard key differes deppending on the current mode. Vim has three main modes namely Normal(Command) mode, Insert mode and visual mode.
By defalult when vim is started it goes into the normal mode. In order to add text you need to enter the instert mode by pressing th <i> key and then typing the required text and then <escape> to return to the normal mode.
